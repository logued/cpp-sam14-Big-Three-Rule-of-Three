// belonging to the source object, is properly copied to dynamically allocated memory
// belonging to the destination object.

/* the stream insertion "operator<<" is invoked by the following pattern :
   "outputStream << Student"  e.g. cout << s1;
   Note that this is somewhat equivalent to the .toString() method in Java.
   It allows us to 'dump' and object's contents to the output stream.
