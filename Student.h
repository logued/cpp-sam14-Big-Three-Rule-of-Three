    // being constructed (the destination).

    // When each Student object goes out of scope, or is deleted,
    // its destructor is called.

    // has been allocated by this object. Omitting this will cause memory leaks.

    // belonging to the source object, is properly copied to dynamically allocated memory
    // belonging to the destination object.

    // operator in front of their definition in the Student.cpp file).

    // direct access to the fields (member data).
